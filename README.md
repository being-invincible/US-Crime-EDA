Welcome to the US Crime Data Exploration and Analysis project! This repository is a comprehensive exploration of crime trends in the United States, utilizing data from the year 2022. The main objective of this project is to delve deeper into the dataset, identifying frequent types of crimes and uncovering valuable insights to aid law enforcement agencies in resource allocation and crime prevention strategies.

The project encompasses a wide range of analytical techniques, including data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. We leverage the power of Excel to clean and manipulate the dataset, creating visualizations such as Pareto charts, histograms, heat maps, and trendlines. Additionally, we delve into the realm of SQL to create a database, perform queries, and analyze crime data from different perspectives.

The ultimate goal is to empower readers, whether they are data enthusiasts or law enforcement professionals, to leverage these insights for effective decision-making and crime prevention strategies.
